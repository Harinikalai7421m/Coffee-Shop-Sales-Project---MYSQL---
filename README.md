## Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase,we performed the following tasks:
 
  Data loading.
  
  Handling missing values.
 
  Data Cleaning and formatting.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

  Data Inspection:
        
        SELECT queries to view data samples.
  
  Summary Statistics:
       
       Compute metrics like count, sum, average, min, and max using aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX).

       Analyze frequency distributions with GROUP BY and ORDER BY.

  Trends and Patterns:
      
       Use time-based grouping (GROUP BY MONTH) to identify trends.

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
     
     1.The total sales for the coffee shop amount to 156,728, with a total of 33,527 orders.
     
     2.Weekdays consistently generate higher total sales compared to weekends.

      Expand the coffee product line by introducing new flavors or premium options to attract a broader customer base.
      
      Ensure adequate staffing and inventory levels during weekdays to meet higher demand efficiently.
